ascii art for each day of the week
	needs access to date/time

ascii is made in a folder of text files so the headder need to be able to access and print those
a goodbye ascii messgae when exiting the program.
		---its own headder file

ask how the day was?

20(+) (?funny?)icebreaker promopts
	randmoly different each time
		--- its own headder file 

changed my mind. there will be 32 just because the computer i intend to soley use as a journal is a 32bit machine (just for funzies)
still randomized and in its own headder.

different color text for hte prompts and the user-input
have a dely in the charecter printing on the promots?

store it in a vector so that it can be indexed and accessed?
